Lastly, you will need to add customization to the existing web applications on an ongoing basis.\n\u2022 Manage, solve and improve complexities in the technology stack; at TimePlay we don\u2019t always do everything in a standard way, therefore we will rely on you to de-construct complex business requirements and rely on your ability to think outside the box to help TimePlay achieve its goals. On a regular basis you will be required to provide technical guidance and support in resolving critical issues that center around the streaming platform, the game controllers, and other components of our technology.\n\u2022 Act as a leader on the team and mentor junior team members; collaboration with team members is our top priority. You will be working with people both senior and junior to you, whom you will be expected to mentor and guide through the many challenges they may face, like the learning curve of a new technology or a challenging technical task.\n\nWho you are:\n\u2022 A leader; that can mean many things but at TimePlay that means you work with others to positively solve-problems, you look for possibilities instead of putting up roadblocks, you drop any ego around your work and are willing to be the first person to make a sacrifice for the team.\n\u2022 Curious learner who is always executing; as a senior developer we expect that you\u2019re always curious about how things work and willing to dig into learning something new at all times. This curiosity and learning translates into you being proactive about working on priorities and being ambitious about what we can achieve together. You don\u2019t need someone to tell you what to do next, and are happy to take the lead.\n\u2022 A humble collaborator; Our biggest team priority is collaboration and seeking different opinions and perspectives. You are someone who\u2019s ego doesn\u2019t get in the way of sharing work, being open to making change and admitting when you don\u2019t know.\n\u2022 Calculated risk taker; you use as much input and data as possible before you make a decision, but you also know when to take a risk in order to move something forward. You focus on how things can be improved and are constantly learning from failure. Not only do you do this for your role, but you work to create a culture of learning from failure for the junior team.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 Experience working with Node.js\n\u2022 Experience working with relational and document databases\n\u2022 Experience in building fault-tolerant, distributed systems\n\u2022 Experience with AWS is an asset\n\u2022 Experience working with Python is an asset\n\u2022 Experience working with one of React, Mithril.js is an asset\n\u2022 Unix/Linux background is an asset\n\nWhy Work With Us:\n\nWe offer so much more than a competitive salary ($90k-100k for this role), a health and dental plan with a generous health spending account, and an employee stock option plan, though we know those are important too. At its core, TimePlay is a high-tech, cutting edge platform and we believe that nothing is impossible. We don\u2019t settle for mediocrity. We view challenges as opportunities and constantly push the boundaries because that\u2019s how greatness is achieved. We\u2019ve been around for a while, but we\u2019re a small and nimble team that believes in innovation and progress. Because of our size and the value we place on collaboration, you will have the opportunity to work with senior leaders, share your ideas, and influence the direction of our business. If you\u2019re a passionate learner who is motivated by the potential to shape your own work and the future of your career, we want to hear from you!\n\nTo Apply:\n\nWe are a respectful workplace committed to building a skilled and diverse workforce. We believe in fostering an inclusive work environment where all individuals have an opportunity to succeed. We welcome and encourage applications from everyone. Requests for accommodation can be made at any stage of the recruitment process.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!\n\nTimePlay focuses on Games, Social Games, and Mobile Games.
