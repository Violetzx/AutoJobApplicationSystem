In just three years, we\u2019ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits.

Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you\u2019ll shape our company culture as we scale. We\u2019re looking for engineers who are excited about our mission and the challenges it entails.\n\nWho You Are:\n\u2022 You write idiomatic JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, Scala, or Ruby.\n\u2022 You build modern, resilient and operationally sane backend systems exemplifying industry standards (HTTP REST, GraphQL, Stream processing, Big Data).\n\u2022 You enjoy teaching and mentoring teammates on backend system best practices and architecture\n\u2022 You work well with product to clarify and translate requirements for teammates\n\u2022 You use a modern version-control system for your source code repository (Git, Mercurial, GitHub, BitBucket).\n\u2022 You lint all your code or know you should.\n\u2022 You know what parts of your code require tests and you write those tests.\n\u2022 You use objective judgment in leveraging the right frameworks and technologies.\n\u2022 You are versed in cloud computing systems (GCP, AWS, etc.) and SAAS concepts.\n\u2022 You leverage continuous integration systems to their full extent (CircleCI, Bamboo, Jenkins, TravisCI).\n\u2022 You plan for, build, evolve and scrutinize monitoring and alerting for your production systems.\n\u2022 You are willing and able to deploy, troubleshoot, and maintain your systems in production and staging environments.\n\nExtra Credit:\n\u2022 Experience with Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, CircleCI, Git, Golang, Java\n\u2022 Experience with GraphQL, GraphQL Federation, REST APIs and supporting network protocols\n\u2022 Experience with a distributed SQL platform like CockroachDB or Google Spanner\n\u2022 Experience with Hadoop, MapReduce, or other \u201cBig Data\u201d systems\n\nWe are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you\u2019re from a background that\u2019s underrepresented in tech, we\u2019d love to meet you!\n\nSalary and Benefits\n\nThis is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.\n\nWe\u2019re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.\n\nWe offer competitive pay \u2014 including equity \u2014 and generous benefits:\n\u2022 Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered\n\u2022 15 vacation days & ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)\n\u2022 Free membership to OneMedical\n\u2022 $1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work\n\u2022 Student loan repayment assistance, 401(k), and optional HSA\n\u2022 Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats\n\u2022 Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues\n\nWe anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $160,000 to $220,000 in addition to equity and benefits.

But we care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.\n\nAs for Covid: When the pandemic started, we immediately shifted to fully remote to protect our team and shuttered our office. Today, everyone on the team is vaccinated, and many come in often (though we don\u2019t require it). Going forward, you can expect that vaccinations will be required for all employees (unless medically unable) and that if a variant emerges that makes in-person work unsafe for vaccinated people, we\u2019ll close our office, cease any travel, and do whatever it takes to protect and support our team", "occupation": "software engineer"}, {"title": "Software Engineer at Cloud9 Esports, Inc. in Los Angeles, CA", "company": "Cloud9 Esports, Inc.", "location": "Los Angeles, CA, USA", "via": "via Los Angeles CA Geebo.com Free Classifieds Ads - Geebo", "time": "3 days ago", "type": "Full-time", "salary": "none", "links": ["https://losangeles-ca.geebo.com/jobs-online/view/id/1054595381-software-engineer-at-cloud9-/?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic"], "description": "Who We Are Cloud9 Esports is the premier esports organization in the world.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it...\n\nAtticus makes it easy for any person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In just three years, we\u2019ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we\u2019ve gotten thousands of people access to over $2B in life-changing aid, and we\u2019re just getting started.\n\nWe've helped more than 20,000 people in need (see our 6,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $50 million from top VC firms like Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We just closed our Series B round in May 2023, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast \u2014 our team grew from 32 to 60 last year and we expect to double in size again in 2023.\n\nThe Job\n\nAtticus works in an industry dominated by outdated technology that is ripe for fresh thinking: our core competitors rely on massive call centers to screen clients, antiquated CRMs to track and manage cases, and paper checks to get paid (provided they\u2019re sent to the right address).\n\nAs a VC-backed tech company our product & engineering department powers everything we do: from creating an engaging online experience for people in crisis to providing tools for our network lawyers as they serve our clients, Atticus relies on technology to fulfill our mission.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a SDET to join our team. You\u2019ll work on automation testing for backend and web, and will partner with every department at Atticus as we continue to grow our platform in an effort to help people in need find trusted legal support.\n\nWhat You'll Do:\n\u2022 Design and build Atticus\u2019 testing strategy with a focus on performance, modularity, extensibility, and reliability.\n\u2022 Work with product to evaluate and refine product details and acceptance criteria.\n\u2022 Architect, design, write, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.\n\u2022 Leverage your peers as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services.\n\nThe role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup that doubles as a B-corp social enterprise. Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you\u2019ll shape our company culture as we scale. We\u2019re looking for engineers who are excited about our mission and the challenges it entails.\n\nWho You Are:\n\u2022 You\u2019ve tested modern backend systems exemplifying industry standards (HTTP REST, GraphQL, Stream processing, Big Data).\n\u2022 You enjoy working with UI and UX experts to build compelling user experiences.\n\u2022 You enjoy teaching and mentoring teammates on testing best practices and architecture.\n\u2022 You\u2019ve tested CSS and HTML extensively\n\u2022 You work well with product to clarify and translate requirements for teammates.\n\u2022 You lint all your code or know you should.\n\u2022 You know what parts of your code require tests and you write those tests.\n\u2022 You use objective judgment in leveraging the right frameworks and technologies.\n\u2022 You are versed in cloud computing systems (GCP, AWS, etc.) and SAAS concepts.\n\u2022 You leverage continuous integration systems to their full extent (CircleCI, Bamboo, Jenkins, TravisCI).\n\nExtra Credit:\n\u2022 Experience with Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, CircleCI, Git, Golang, TypeScript\n\u2022 Experience with GraphQL, GraphQL Federation, REST APIs and supporting network protocols\n\u2022 Experience with a distributed SQL platforms like CockroachDB or Google Spanner\n\u2022 Experience with Playwright or similar testing frameworks such as Selenium/Cypress\n\nWe are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you\u2019re from a background that\u2019s underrepresented in tech, we\u2019d love to meet you!\n\nSalary and Benefits\n\nThis is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.\n\nWe\u2019re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.\n\nWe offer competitive pay \u2014 including equity \u2014 and generous benefits:\n\u2022 Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered\n\u2022 15 vacation days & ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)\n\u2022 Free membership to OneMedical\n\u2022 $1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work\n\u2022 Student loan repayment assistance, 401(k), and optional HSA\n\u2022 Free snacks, drinks, weekly lunches, and regular team dinners/events/retreats\n\u2022 Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues\n\nWe anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $160,000 to $200,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate\u2019s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.\n\nLocation & Covid\n\nToday, about half our team are in Los Angeles or Phoenix (where we have offices) and half are fully remote and spread across the U.S. There are two options for this job:\n\u2022 Live in Los Angeles, work a few days a week (or more) out of our beautiful office in the Arts District.\n\u2022 Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues \u2014somewhere between monthly and quarterly.\n\nIn short: You can do this job well remotely, and we\u2019re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. But we care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.\n\nAs for Covid: When the pandemic started, we immediately shifted to fully remote to protect our team and shuttered our office. Today, everyone on the team is vaccinated, and many come in often (though we don\u2019t require it). Going forward, you can expect that vaccinations will be required for all employees (unless medically unable) and that if a variant emerges that makes in-person work unsafe for vaccinated people, we\u2019ll close our office, cease any travel, and do whatever it takes to protect and support our team", "occupation": "software engineer"}, {"title": "Software Engineer, Full Stack (Remote)", "company": "Q&A Media", "location": "Los Angeles, CA, USA", "via": "via CareerBuilder", "time": "6 days ago", "type": "Full-time", "salary": "none", "links": ["https://www.careerbuilder.com/job/J3V3H565P1JCTFJJ1SM?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic", "https://www.learn4good.com/jobs/online_remote/software_development/2639206810/e/?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic"], "description": "Venice Music is a fast-moving, progressive, inclusive, and pioneering music company, combining key pillars of artist management, distribution tech, and record label.
