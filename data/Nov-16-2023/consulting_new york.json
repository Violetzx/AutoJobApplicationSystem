Our global clients include Amazon, Deloitte, Salesforce, IBM, and other Fortune 500 companies. We make an investment to train our Consulting Executives, who then deliver highly-interactive workshops to Corporate Visions clients. In a pre-COVID world, our workshops were typically conducted in-person at client HQ or regional office locations. In the future, these workshops will be delivered in-person and on virtual platforms as well- but ability to travel is a prerequisite. While growing for more than 30 years, Corporate Vision's business is at record-breaking levels given new client expansion across multiple industry sectors. As a result, we are recruiting Consulting Executives in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. In addition, we are specifically recruiting a U.S.-based English/Spanish candidate with native Spanish fluency. Within our Elevate Value practice, we recruit only C-level executives- e.g. 15+ years of senior executive experience as CEO, President, COO, CIO, CTO, CMO, CRO, CHRO etc. While P&L experience is typically preferred, candidates must possess strong financial acumen. We're not seeking professional consultants, but rather C-levels who wish to consult and are intellectually interested in our work and client set. The successful candidate will have served in the C-suite within a market-leading enterprise of $500M+ revenue, fluent in C-level metrics, and have experience negotiating externally with other C-levels. As our work includes Executive role-plays with client participants, you will work well in high-intensity situations while providing experienced-based executive mentorship and coaching. Must be a natural storyteller with a sense of humor/fun in approach. If you're a C-suite executive keenly interested in human capital as much as working capital, this is the perfect opportunity to leverage your years of C-level experience with a flexible lifestyle, all while provoking your own intellectual curiosity and having fun along the way.\n\nTravel Percent\nLess than 10%\n\nFunctions\n\u2022 CEO/President\n\u2022 General Management\n\u2022 Information Technology\n\u2022 Marketing\n\u2022 Sales/Revenue\n\u2022 Operations\n\u2022 Strategy\n\u2022 Human Resources\n\u2022 Business Development\n\u2022 Finance\n\u2022 Product Management\n\u2022 Product Marketing\n\nSkills\n\u2022 Consulting required", "occupation": "consulting"}, {"title": "Strategy Principal Consultant", "company": "Capco", "location": "United States", "via": "via LinkedIn", "time": "3 days ago", "type": "Full-time", "salary": "none", "links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/strategy-principal-consultant-at-capco-3764983110?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic"], "description": "About the Team:\n\nCapco is a distinctly and positively different place to work.
